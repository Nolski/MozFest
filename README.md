Session Materials for MozFest


This is a simple calculator project. Do not expect it to function correctly. 

You might also find some **ententional** typos on this **reposatory.** 

Do not be alarmed, and do not call the **grammer** or typo police. It is part of the learning process. :)

- Initial bug free [source](http://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/calculator) code. If you are participating in the session do not view the bug free code till the end.
